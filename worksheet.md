# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

* These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites?  What service do they provide? Which is better?

Bitbucket is made for private repositories. Github would be better for hosting public projects developed by members of a community, while Bitbucket is better for private projects.

* Who made the last commit to repository A?

Matthew Roberts

* Who made the first commit to repository A?

Jon Mountjoy

* Who made the first and last commits to repository B?

DavePearce

* Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?

Project A had been inactive for the last few months but was recently pushed to use V5 surveys.
Project B has been inacive for nearly a month but its possible the developer is just taking a break.

* ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?

in project A two_d.html was last updated while in active development but since then app.py has been updated.

in project B pom.xml was last updated.

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints
